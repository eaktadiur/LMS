Installation Instruction
========================

1. Install the Web Server Apache 2.0.
2. Install PHP => 5.2.5. Control, that in the file 'php.ini' the include-path has the entry './;'.
3. Install a Database System (Mysl, Postgresql, Access with ODBC ..) with the permissions to read and
   write tables for the user, which the Webserver is using(e.g. wwwrun).
4. With 'tar -zxvf repgen-045.tgz' copy all Files in a subdirectory (e.g. repgen) of the Apache directory 'htdocs'.
   (With a MS-Windows system you may use Winzip to uncompress repgen.)
   A Subdirectory 'fonts' and 'tmp' has been created in the directory. In these subdirectories the Web Server should
   have rights to write. Change the constant 'REPGENDIR' in the file 'repgen-def.inc' to the 
   subdirectory, where the PHP-Sources are stored.Change also the value for the constant 'DBDRIVER'
   in the file 'repgen-def.inc'. Change the constant 'LANGUAGE' in the file 'repgen-def.inc' to 
   the wanted language 'repgen-const-<language>.inc'.
5. Run 'reports.sql' to create the table 'reports' and 'schuessel' in the database. A sample report will be 
   installed. If you are using Postgresql, don't forget to give create, update, insert, delete rights
   on the tables 'reports' and 'schluessel' for the host 'localhost' in the file 'pg_hba.conf'


6. On a Linux-System 
       - go to the installation directory (e.g. htdocs/repgen)
       - write:   chown <user>:nogroup . -R    (don't forget the dot!)
       - write:   chmod oa+r . -R
       - write:   chmod oa+w fonts
                  chmod oa+w tmp


7. Change the variables '$database,$host,$user,$password' and 'require' in the file 'sample-mysql.php'
   (or the others) and test the application 'http://<yourserver>/repgen/sample-mysql.php' from your 
   browser with an Acrobat Reader plug-in.
